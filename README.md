# rnmf
Numerical method framework written in Rust.


## The idea
My goal is to implement these eventually, and not necessarily in this order

    * Support many types of mesh in 1, 2, and 3D
        * Cartesian (eventually with ability to adaptively refine)
        * Structured, non-cartesian
        * Unstructured
    * Provide vectorised/parallelisable data structures for the types of mesh (e.g. tile-able data structures)
    * Provide framework for simple PDEs with FD discretisation
    * Provide support for particles
    * Use rLua to be able to use Lua to configure the simulation. Ideally will be able to run a sim in two ways:
        * Passing Lua script to executable as command line argument
        * Running the simulation directly from lua script
